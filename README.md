# PicoVectorscope

This is a work-in-progress project for driving an XY oscilloscope using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a couple of 12-bit parallel DACs (I'm using `AD767JN`s).

The idea is to be able to write awesome vector games.

Once I've got something worth sharing, I'll make a `main` branch, but right now I'm living in `bringup` where I can make large changes and refactors without worrying about it.
