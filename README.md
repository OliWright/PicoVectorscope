# PicoVectorscope

This is a work-in-progress project for driving an XY oscilloscope using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a couple of 12-bit parallel DACs (I'm using `AD767JN`s).

I highly recommend starting out with the [PicoVectorscopeExamples](https://github.com/OliWright/PicoVectorscopeExamples) project which includes this project as a submodule.

The idea is to be able to write awesome vector games.  You can see it in action in this video, where it also has a go at some raster:
